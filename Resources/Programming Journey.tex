			My initiation into the world of programming began in 2012, thanks to Minecraft. I delved into modded Minecraft and stumbled upon ComputerCraft, a mod that ingeniously incorporated DOS-like computers within the game. Fascinatingly, these virtual computers were programmable using Lua, enabling me to tinker with existing programs and eventually create and execute my first programs.

			Early in my secondary school days, I was introduced to a few graphical programming languages. These primarily consisted of drag-and-drop interfaces designed for script construction. However, the real intrigue came a couple of years later, when I encountered Visual Basic. Here, I embarked on creating console-based conversational trees, deepening my understanding of logical flows and interactivity.

			My enthusiasm for Minecraft did not wane; in fact, it spurred a personal challenge. Determined to put my own spin on the game, I delved into Java, teaching myself through a plethora of online tutorials. My perseverance bore fruit as I successfully managed to both create new Minecraft mods and recreate existing ones, allowing me to tailor my gameplay experience and furthering my programming prowess.

			My GCSE years in secondary school marked another milestone in my programming journey. I was introduced to Python 2.7 in my computer science class, which further refined my programming skills and expanded my knowledge of software development principles.

		{Education}

			Upon completing secondary school, I wasted no time and immediately began my first apprenticeship.

			As I transitioned into my apprenticeship, my programming journey took a more nuanced turn. I not only learned C\# but also harnessed its synergy with SQL to develop MVC applications. It was during this period that I was formally introduced to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). A later module also covered foundational web technologies and I had to develop an interactive web-app from the ground up in HTML, CSS, and JS.

			My understanding deepened as I familiarised myself with core principles including Pareto, DRY, SOLID, YAGNI, the Law of Demeter (LoD), Conway's Law, and the concepts of Cohesion and Coupling.

		{First job in Software : IT and IPC Control Systems}
		{Work}
		{\\
			My tenure at Labman, which was an integral part of my college apprenticeship, presented a unique set of challenges and opportunities. Initially, given the time-intensive nature of my mentor's high-value project, my exposure to the intricacies of software engineering was limited. As such, much of my role was characterised by generic IT tasks, encompassing a wide spectrum of responsibilities. \\

		However, as my time at Labman drew closer to its conclusion, I found myself integrated into a dynamic team. In these final two months, I collaborated closely with an electrical engineer and a senior software engineer, working on a pivotal project. Here, I ventured into programming for Beckhoff IPCs, working in both Ladder Logic and Structured Text. Furthermore, I honed my skills in SQL and contributed alongside my team, who were engaged in crafting a core component in C++.

		{Work}
		{\\
			Transitioning from Labman, my college presented a new opportunity for me at a budding local start-up named 'Admit Me'. As I embarked on my journey as a web developer, I quickly grasped the volatility of the role â€” finding myself as essentially the sole employee in this venture. Despite the inherent challenges and brevity of my tenure, it was a period of rapid enlightenment. It was here that I delved into the vast expanse of web development, encountering tools and frameworks like Ruby On Rails, Bootstrap, and PostgreSQL. I rapidly assimilated these technologies, constructing web scrapers and delivering websites for clients under tight deadlines. While the role was transient, the exposure and experience I gained were invaluable.
