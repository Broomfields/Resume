# Résumé Repository

Hello! This repository is the source control for my professional résumé, crafted in LaTeX and exported to PDF. It also contains various supporting resources to complement my résumé.

## Structure

- 📄 **Résumé** - The primary LaTeX source for my résumé is in `/LaTeX/Resume/Resume - Shaun Broomfield.tex`, with the generated PDF at `/LaTeX/Resume/Resume - Shaun Broomfield.pdf`.
- 🖼 **Images** - All the images referenced in the résumé are stored in the `/Resources` directory.
- 📝 **Text Documents** - Supplementary text documents can be found under `/Resources`.
- 🌐 **LinkedIn Extract** - A JSON extract of my LinkedIn page is saved as `/JSON/resume.json`.

## Build

I built this résumé in TexWorks using the `developer-cv` template.

The template was created by:
- Jan Vorisek (jan@vorisek.me)
  - Based on a template by Jan Küster (info@jankuester.com)
    - Modified for LaTeX Templates by Vel (vel@LaTeXTemplates.com)
